                <h2>About IA-GAANN</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Certain risks of large-scale critical networked systems have gained widespread recognition, e.g., cascading failures of power systems. The number, speed, and sophistication of attacks on networked systems are increasing dramatically, necessitating urgent action towards improved methods and techniques of assuring and maintaining information integrity, 24x7 availability, and system reliability. Impetus for addressing this need is provided by the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which highlights the urgency of significant efforts to improve the understanding, correctness, security, and information assurance of critical infrastructures. "Securing cyberspace" and "Restoration and improvement of urban infrastructure" are two of the fourteen Grand Challenges for Engineering identified by the National Academy of Engineering. Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), which spans these two challenges, is vital to industry, government, and society as a whole. President Obamaâ€™s Strategy for American Innovation further underscores this urgency of CIP by calling for investments in "Building a leading physical infrastructure" and "Developing an advanced information technology ecosystem," as building blocks for American Innovation.

                    Our primary objective for this GAANN program is to increase the number of US citizens, including those from underrepresented groups, who will pursue teaching and research careers in information and system assurance of critical infrastructure, an area of urgent national need. This area is also the thrust of Missouri S&T's certification by the National Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research and Education, uniquely positioning the team for this effort. The GAANN program will establish a commonality among critical infrastructures for assurance purposes, using commodity flow as a fundamental concept. Conceptually, both information and actual physical material flow are commodities; flow provides an overarching rubric, so that information assurance for infrastructure systems can be analyzed in a consistent, structured, and unified way - a true systems engineering approach.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    This doctoral program brings together a truly interdisciplinary team of faculty, where diverse talents from the computing area are complemented by practical domain knowledge of specific critical infrastructure systems, including the power grid, the ground transportation infrastructure, and water distribution networks. Missouri S&T is uniquely positioned for conducting this program, with a long tradition of interdisciplinary research, and several research centers in possession of unique facilities for empirical studies that investigate the interplay between a physical infrastructure and its cyber control and communication.
